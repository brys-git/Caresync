/**
 * CareSync entitlement cycle model.
 *
 * A "cycle" is one ₱14,500 (MembershipService::TOTAL_CONTRIBUTION) window
 * of contributions toward the Regular Wood Casket (Damayan) entitlement.
 * plans.current_cycle_number identifies which window a plan is currently
 * in; payments.cycle_number and service_applications.cycle_number record
 * which cycle a specific payment or claim belongs/belonged to.
 *
 * A cycle only advances (closeCycleIfSettled()) once BOTH of these are
 * true, whichever happens last:
 *   (a) the cycle's ₱14,500 target is fully paid, and
 *   (b) the entitlement package has been claimed (approved) in this cycle
 *
 * This replaces the old behaviour where approving a claim zeroed
 * months_paid immediately (ClaimService::
 * resetContributionCycleIfEntitlementClaim(), now stampClaimCycle()) -
 * that destroyed a plan holder's progress if they claimed before finishing
 * paying off the current cycle. Two states fall out of the two conditions
 * above not being met at the same time:
 *
 *   'claimed_owing'  - claimed early, ₱14,500 not yet fully paid. Keeps
 *                       paying down the same cycle; CLAIM stays disabled
 *                       (already claimed this cycle).
 *   'paid_unclaimed' - ₱14,500 fully paid, no claim made yet. Owes
 *                       nothing further, CLAIM stays enabled indefinitely
 *                       until used, and the plan must be exempted from
 *                       overdue/delinquency/forfeiture processing - see
 *                       afterPaymentVerified() (clears next_due_date) and
 *                       the exemption checks in OverduePolicyService::
 *                       applyForfeitures() and MembershipService::
 *                       updateMembershipStates().
 *
 * plans.contribution_cycle_started_at (Phase 0) keeps its existing job:
 * it marks "count progress from here forward only" *within* whichever
 * cycle is current. That's what lets a 60-day forfeiture reset progress
 * without also closing/advancing the cycle - forfeiture still zeroes
 * months_paid and bumps this marker exactly as it always has, but never
 * touches current_cycle_number, so a plan holder who already claimed in
 * cycle 3 and then gets forfeited stays in cycle 3, still marked claimed,
 * and has to earn back to ₱14,500 within cycle 3 before it closes. Nothing
 * claws back an already-issued casket.
