/**
 * Restores `plans.package_id`.
 *
 * A migration named AddPackageIdToPlans ran historically (it's recorded in
 * the migrations table, batch 1) but its file no longer exists in this
 * project, and the column isn't on the live table — it was apparently
 * dropped by hand at some point in favor of `program_id` /
 * `membership_programs`, a simpler single-row stand-in that every plan
 * currently points at. `packages` / `package_versions` is the system that
 * actually supports multiple tiers and price versioning (what "different
 * packages/benefit tiers" and upgrade paths need), so it's the one that
 * should be the real system of record going forward — this migration just
 * re-adds the column that connects a plan to it. Wiring an actual
 * package-picking "Create Plan" UI on top of this, and migrating billing
 * logic off program_id, is later-phase work.
 *
 * Backfilled via the existing `version_id` column, which — unlike
 * package_id — was never removed: every plan already points at a real
 * package_versions row, and that row names its package. Nothing about this
 * backfill is guesswork.
