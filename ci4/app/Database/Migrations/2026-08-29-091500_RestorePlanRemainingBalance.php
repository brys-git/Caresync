/**
 * Restores `plans.remaining_balance` as a real column.
 *
 * Some earlier, unrecorded manual change renamed it to
 * `legacy_remaining_balance` — but that rename was never propagated to the
 * application. Fifteen-plus places across PaymentService, ReportService,
 * MembershipService, ClientService, and several controllers still
 * unconditionally SELECT/WHERE/UPDATE `plans.remaining_balance` with no
 * existence guard (unlike `total_plan_amount`, which the code already checks
 * for defensively before using). Against the current schema every one of
 * those call sites throws "Unknown column 'remaining_balance'" — in
 * particular PaymentService::recomputePlan(), which runs after every
 * payment is recorded.
 *
 * Given how many independent, otherwise-correct files agree on this column
 * name, the schema is what drifted — not the application. Restoring the
 * column (backfilled from legacy_remaining_balance's existing values) is far
 * safer than rewriting business logic across a dozen files to chase a
 * rename with no recorded rationale. legacy_remaining_balance is left in
 * place, untouched, rather than dropped.
