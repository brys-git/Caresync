## Current System Architecture

### Routes Organization
```
Config/
├── Routes.php (main file with require statements)
└── Routes/
    ├── auth.php (public routes)
    ├── admin.php (role 1 routes)
    ├── branch_admin.php (role 2 routes)
    ├── staff.php (role 3 routes)
    ├── client.php (role 4 routes)
    └── api.php (future API endpoints)
```

### Services Layer
```
Services/
├── MembershipService.php (membership logic)
├── PaymentService.php (payment handling)
├── NotificationService.php (notifications)
├── ActivityLogService.php (audit logs)
├── ApprovalService.php (approval workflows)
├── ReportService.php (reporting)
├── SchedulingService.php (NEW - scheduling)
├── ServiceManagementService.php (service management)
├── StaffManagementService.php (staff management)
├── ClientService.php (client-related logic)
└── StaffService.php (staff-related logic)
```

### Database Schema
**New Tables:**
- `hearses` - Hearse fleet management
- `embalmers` - Embalmer directory
- `staff_schedules` - Staff duty scheduling
- `service_calendar` - Funeral event calendar

**Enhanced Tables:**
- `notifications` - Added type, priority, read_at, is_archived columns

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexing:**
   - Indexed by status fields for faster queries
   - Indexed by dates for range queries
   - Indexed by branch_id for role-based filtering
   - Foreign key relationships for referential integrity

2. **Query Optimization:**
   - Reduced N+1 query problems
   - Used `JOIN` instead of multiple queries
   - Indexed frequently filtered columns

3. **Caching Considerations:**
   - Analytics data can be cached for dashboard display
   - Membership status checks can use short-term cache
   - Notification count can be cached per user

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - All routes filtered by `role:X` filter
   - Branch_id validation for multi-branch isolation
   - User ownership validation for sensitive operations

2. **Data Validation:**
   - All input validated before database operations
   - Date/time validation prevents invalid data
   - Numeric validation for IDs and amounts

3. **Transaction Support:**
   - Database transactions for multi-step operations
   - Automatic rollback on errors
   - Data consistency guarantees

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests to Create:
1. `SchedulingService` - Resource availability checks
2. `MembershipService` - Membership state transitions
3. `NotificationService` - Notification creation and retrieval
4. `Analytics` - Query correctness

### Integration Tests:
1. End-to-end scheduling workflow
2. Payment approval with membership updates
3. Service application eligibility checks

### Load Testing:
1. Analytics query performance under load
2. Concurrent service scheduling
3. Batch notification sending
