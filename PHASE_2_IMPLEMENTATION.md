**Membership Logic Enhancement, Due-Date Automation, Service Eligibility, Scheduling, and Beneficiary Claim Validation**

**Implementation Date:** May 7, 2026

---

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### PART 1: Replace Remaining Balance Logic with Due-Date Based Membership Tracking

**Database Changes Applied:**
- ✅ Added `next_due_date` (DATE) to plans table
- ✅ Added `payment_coverage_until` (DATE) to plans table  
- ✅ Added `overdue_months` (INT) to plans table
- ✅ Added `membership_state` (ENUM: active/delinquent/suspended/completed) to plans table
- ✅ `remaining_balance` column kept for backward compatibility but no longer used

**Migration Files Created:**
- `2026-05-07-100000_AddMembershipTrackingToPlan.php` - Smart migration checks for existing columns

**Service Layer Enhancements ([MembershipService.php](ci4/app/Services/MembershipService.php)):**

1. **`applyMembershipCoverage(int $planId, int $monthsCovered): bool`**
   - Extends payment_coverage_until date
   - Calculates next_due_date automatically
   - Resets overdue_months to 0 on successful payment
   - Updates months_paid accumulator
   - Used for both initial and advance payments

2. **`updateMembershipStates(): array`**
   - Runs daily to check all active plans
   - Compares current date against payment_coverage_until
   - Calculates overdue months: `DateTime::diff()`
   - Updates membership_state based on rules:
     - 0-2 months overdue → `active`
     - 3-5 months overdue → `delinquent`
     - 6+ months overdue → `suspended`
   - Returns summary counts

3. **`calculateOverdueMonths(string $coverageUntilDate, string $currentDate): int`**
   - Private helper for date math
   - Safe DateTime exception handling

4. **`getMembershipSummary(int $planHolderId): ?array`**
   - Returns enhanced membership details
   - Includes: plan_id, status, membership_state, monthly_fee, months_paid, start_date
   - Includes: next_due_date, payment_coverage_until, overdue_months
   - Includes: can_access_services (boolean)

---

### PART 2: Add Delinquency Validation for Service Eligibility

**Service Eligibility Rules:**
- Member can apply for services if:
  - Plan status = `active`
  - Membership state = `active` (not delinquent or suspended)
  - Overdue months ≤ 2 (grace period for delinquency)

**New Service Method ([MembershipService.php](ci4/app/Services/MembershipService.php)):**

`canAccessServices(int $planHolderId): bool`
- Validates service eligibility
- Returns false if plan inactive or member delinquent beyond grace period

**Controller Updates ([ClientPortal.php](ci4/app/Controllers/ClientPortal.php)):**

Updated methods:
- `submitServiceApplication(int $serviceListId)` - Added eligibility check
- `submitPackageApplication(int $packageId)` - Added eligibility check

**UI Validation Messages:**
- "Your membership is currently delinquent. Please update your monthly contributions to access funeral services."
- "Your membership status does not allow service access at this time."

---

### PART 3: Standardize Membership Terminology

**UI Label Updates:**
- "Remaining Balance" → Removed from client-facing views
- "Plan Package" → "Membership Program" (Damayan Burial Program)
- "Status" → Now shows "Membership State" (active/delinquent/suspended)

**Database Structure:**
- `membership_programs` table stores: Damayan Burial Program (only)
- `packages` table stores: Funeral Service Packages (separate)
- Controllers now distinguish between membership and service packages

---

### PART 4: Add Automatic Due-Date Monitoring

**Automated Command ([UpdateMembershipStatus.php](ci4/app/Commands/UpdateMembershipStatus.php)):**

```bash
php spark membership:update-status
```

Features:
- Updates all active plan memberships
- Calculates overdue months for each
- Updates membership_state based on delinquency
- Returns summary: active/delinquent/suspended/updated counts
- CLI-friendly output with colored status
- Can be scheduled via cron job for daily execution

**Usage Example:**
```bash
# Manual execution
php spark membership:update-status

# Cron job (run daily at 2 AM)
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/ci4 && php spark membership:update-status
```

---

### PART 5: Expand Funeral Service Scheduling System

**New Database Tables Created:**

1. **`service_schedules` table:**
   - `schedule_id` (PK, auto-increment)
   - `service_application_id` (FK)
   - `service_date` (DATE)
   - `service_time` (TIME)
   - `branch_id` (INT)
   - `status` (ENUM: pending/scheduled/ongoing/completed/cancelled)
   - `created_at`, `updated_at` (DATETIME)
   - Migration: `2026-05-07-120000_CreateServiceSchedulesTable.php`

2. **`resource_assignments` table:**
   - `assignment_id` (PK, auto-increment)
   - `schedule_id` (FK)
   - `staff_id` (INT)
   - `vehicle_id` (INT)
   - `resource_type` (ENUM: staff/vehicle/equipment)
   - `status` (ENUM: assigned/in_use/completed/cancelled)
   - `created_at`, `updated_at` (DATETIME)
   - Migration: `2026-05-07-130000_CreateResourceAssignmentsTable.php`

**Schema supports future features:**
- Branch admin assigns hearse vehicles
- Staff assignments for embalming, setup, etc.
- Service scheduling calendar views
- Staff task tracking and completion updates

---

### PART 6: Beneficiary Claim Verification System

**Database Changes:**

`beneficiaries` table now includes:
- `verification_status` (ENUM: pending/verified/rejected) DEFAULT pending
- Migration: `2026-05-07-110000_AddVerificationStatusToBeneficiaries.php`

**Preparation for Future Claims Module:**
- Structure ready for claim authorization workflow
- Branch admin can verify beneficiary relationships
- Foundation for death assistance processing
- Integration point for funeral claim authorization

## 🔐 Service Eligibility Enforcement

### [ClientPortal.php](ci4/app/Controllers/ClientPortal.php)

**New Eligibility Check in:**
- `submitServiceApplication(int $serviceListId)` - Lines ~596-604
- `submitPackageApplication(int $packageId)` - Lines ~656-664

**Logic Flow:**
```
1. Check if user is approved
2. Get plan holder info
3. Call MembershipService::canAccessServices()
4. If false:
   - Get membership summary
   - If overdue > 2 months → show delinquency message
   - Otherwise → show generic ineligibility message
5. If true → proceed with application
```

---

## 📊 Command Line Tools

### New Command: `membership:update-status`
**File:** [UpdateMembershipStatus.php](ci4/app/Commands/UpdateMembershipStatus.php)
**Usage:** `php spark membership:update-status`

**Output Example:**
```
Membership status update completed:
  - Active members: 47
  - Delinquent members: 8
  - Suspended members: 2
  - Updated: 5
```

---

## 🗄️ Database State After Phase 2

**Plans Table New Columns:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE plans
ADD COLUMN next_due_date DATE NULL,
ADD COLUMN payment_coverage_until DATE NULL,
ADD COLUMN overdue_months INT DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN membership_state ENUM('active', 'delinquent', 'suspended', 'completed') DEFAULT 'active';
```

**Beneficiaries Table Update:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE beneficiaries
ADD COLUMN verification_status ENUM('pending', 'verified', 'rejected') DEFAULT 'pending';
```

**New Tables:**
- `service_schedules` - 8 columns
- `resource_assignments` - 8 columns

---

## 🎯 Key Business Rules Now Enforced

1. **Membership Coverage = Subscription Model**
   - Payment covers member until `payment_coverage_until` date
   - Each month after coverage end = 1 overdue month

2. **Service Eligibility**
   - Only `membership_state = active` members can apply (unless within 2-month grace)
   - Delinquent (3-5 months) = yellow warning
   - Suspended (6+ months) = blocked, contact office

3. **Automatic Status Updates**
   - Run `php spark membership:update-status` daily
   - Automatically transitions members between states
   - No manual intervention needed

4. **Initial Payment Auto-Approval**
   - When initial payment marked paid → plan + holder activated instantly
   - Coverage dates calculated from payment months
   - Next due date set automatically

5. **Advance Payment Logic**
   - Extends coverage_until date
   - Resets overdue_months to 0
   - Triggers member back to active state if delinquent
